# Thesis

This repo contains all the code that was used for my thesis: A deep inverse aerodynamic model, and its application on flapping-wing unmanned aerial vehicles
- Camera: image processing for wing tracking in 3D and Euler angles extraction
- Forces: force sensors signal parser
- Preprocess: data merging, encoding and preprocessing
- ML: multi-dataset multivariate time series framework for inverse physical modeling

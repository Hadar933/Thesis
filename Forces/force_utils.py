	Aside from aerodynamic forces, our wing may also exert an inertial vertical force in z. The reaction force
	(force observed by sensor) in the z	direction will be Fz = â€“ m * z_ddot where z_ddot is the acceleration of the
	centre of mass in z and m is the wing's mass. When acceleration is positive (up), the reaction force on the sensor
	is negative (down). We can break z_ddot down into R * theta_ddot where R = dist from the rotation point to the C.O.M
